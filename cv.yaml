about: |
  <p align='justify'>
  I am a PhD Student at the
  <b>Autonomous University of Madrid</b>
  and study foundational topics in <b>probabilistic machine learning</b> and
  <b>variational inference</b>.
  My research focuses on studying the application of variational inference to modern Bayesian deep learning.
