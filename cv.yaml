about: |
  <p align='justify'>
  I am a PhD Student at the
  <b>Autonomous University of Madrid</b>
  and study foundational topics in <b>machine learning</b> and
  <b>function space inference</b>.
  My research focuses on function space inference, more precisely on studying
  implicit processes and methods of approximating the intractable distributions
  they define.
